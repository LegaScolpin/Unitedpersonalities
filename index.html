			<h2>Updating</h2>
			<p>I think I do worse at updating this site then I do writing in my journal, which is really saying something. But I suppose it makes some sense.
			I don't really have much to update on here recently. Since I'm still in school and still learning a lot of things, I don't really have much to throw on here.
			But I am hoping that I will be able to test of few applications on here. I'm currently taking a programming class and I may have some simple programs to put on here
			as examples of what I'm doing. But we will see what I am able to come up with.</p>
			<p>Anyway, thank you so much for supporting me even though there hasn't been much to support.</p>

			<h2>I am rehosted</h2>
			<p>After a very long time, I have rehosted my site through github pages. This option allows me a lot more control with my site and how it is managed. I still haven't really added anything new to this site but that's mainly been because I haven't had anywhere to host this! But now that I do, things will be better and I should be able to update this site a little bit more... when I feel like it.</p>
            		<p>For now, please enjoy my very simple, very basic site and thank you for supporting me. Hopefully some cool stuff will be coming this way soon.</p>

            		<h2>I'm not dead!</h2>
			<p>Hey everyone! I know its been a really long time but I finally updated the site. I finally found some ambition and a few ideas of what I can 
			use my site for. So as you can see, the site is active again. I decided that if I wasn't using it, I might as well turn it off until I have 
			something to put up.</p>
			<p>To give you an idea of what's coming, you may notice that one of the links above has changed. The new link, "comic", has been added. The 
			site isn't active yet, but Erica and I had a great idea for a web comic so we are gonna work on that sometime.
			Also, I will be adding a new section soon called "Stories". I want to get back into writing probably starting with random short stories just
			so I can have a place to store them. So that's something to look forward to.</p>

				<h2>Happy New Year!</h2>
				<p>Welcome to 2014 everyone! Although, I don't really consider it the new year until I stop writing the year wrong..
				So I'll accept the new year in about three months or so. As some of you may have noticed, I haven't been updating very often
				recently. I got a little busy with work and some other stuff that's been going on with Christmas and the holidays so I haven't
				gotten around to posting updates and getting my other sections posted up. But the main thing I have been concerned about is getting
				this site to show up on a Google search. As of right now, the only way to find this site is to search for either Final Fantasy X reviews,
				Dues Ex reviews, or Minecraft reviews. As happy as I am that my site is showing up for this reviews, I wish it would show up with
				just a search for United Personalities. Since, you know, that is the name of the site. But, I'll work on that when I can..</p>
				<p>I guess since these is my New Years Blog, this would be a good place to put my resolutions for the year. But I don't want to 
				waste your time or my time writing a bunch of resolutions that you and I both know that I'm going to forget about the moment I 
				write them. I only have one real resolution for this year and it is a quote from Gordon B Hinckley: "Try a little harder to be a 
				little better." My only resolution this year is to try and be a better person. That's really the only thing I can promise. But, I 
				hope you will all have a good year and that you can find happiness in what you are doing! See ya!</p>

				<h2>New Reviews</h2>
				<p>Hey everyone! I'd first like to thank everyone who has supported me up to this point and encouraged me to even get this far. 
				You guys have all be awesome! Now onto the actual updates for this post!</p>
				<p>I have added three more game reviews to my "Games" section. One is a review for Minecraft written by me. I highly recommend checking
				it out because it's Minecraft. Everyone loves stuff about Minecraft. The other review is for Deus Ex Human Revolution written by a good
				friend of mine, Tyson Young! And the last one is a review written by my wife, Erica, for Final Fantasy X! So get yourself over to the 
				"Games" section and get it a read! It's definitely worth it.</p>
				<p>There's a lot of plans I have for this place and I'm slowly working on getting things to look nicer, work better and flow smoother.
				So thanks for sticking with me and giving me your comments.</p>

				<h2>I added comments!</h2>
				<p>So, as I mentioned in the last update, I really wanted to find an easy way to add comments to my page. Thanks to the information
				from a friend of mine, the comments section is now active! You will notice that I have replaced the "Links" button with the "Comments"
				button. There you will find a neat little thing that will allow you to post comments to my site! It's really simple, all you have to do
				is log in with your Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ account and then you are free to leave a comment. Your feedback is greatly appreciated
				and I will probably expand the comments section so that it's not just one place on the entire site to comment. But for now, this will work
				quite nicely for what I need it to do. So, again, please let me know what you think and any feedback is greatly appreciated!</p>
