			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Not much really to tell about me. My real name is Colby AKA Scolpin. I'm a web designer whose still in school majoring in
			web design and management. And since I'm still learning, that is why nothing on this page is very fancy.</p>
			
			<h2>What's "The United Personalities"</h2>
			<p>I knew you were going to ask that! The United Personalities comes from an idea that my friends came up with back in high school.
			In high school,  I got along with girls a lot better than I did with guys. Guys were always talking about sports and other stuff that I
			had no knowledge of and no interest in. Girls, on the other hand, were easier to talk to, cuter, and a lot more interesting. So, because of this
			I had a lot of friends that were girls (Clarification! I did not have lots of girlfriends. I was just hung around a lot of girls). One day,
			the girls were talking about their boyfriends and one of them said "You know what? Guys suck!" I replied of course: "Hey! What about me?"
			The reply I received surprised me: "Oh Colby, you don't count. You think more like a girl than a guy. It's like your subconscious is a girl."
			And with that, my alter ego was born: "Lola" So then I had two personalities; myself and Lola, my subconscious.</p>
			<p>From there, the joke just continued and we just started to name my other "personalities." Here's the break down:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Colby: Me, myself, and I</li>
				<li>Lola: My subconscious. generally considered to be evil in most cases</li>
				<li>The Fox: Foxes are my favorite animal and it's been said that I am cunning and clever, like a fox</li>
				<li>Scolpin: My online personality. No one can deny that we act differently online than how we act in real life</li>
				<li>The Fifth: The personality you would see if I ever got angry, which doesn't happen very often. Consider The Fifth to be kinda like the hulk</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>And so, that's basically where the name "The United Personalities" came from. Its me and my "personalities" working together on a set goal.
			Please note: the name does not imply that I have Multiple Personality Disorder. The name of the site just came from an inside joke in high school.</p>
			
			<h2>What's your site for?</h2>
			<p>I don't know. Stuff. Anything I feel like putting up here. Since I'm just beginning my web design program in school, I'm basically using this site
			as a playground. Just to test things and see how they work.</p>
