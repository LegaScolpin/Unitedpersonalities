			<h2 class="center">Final Fantasy X</h2>
				<a href="ffx.html"><img class="displaycenter" src="Images/ffxlogo.jpg" alt="FFX Logo" title="Click for an awesome review!"></a>
				<p>Final Fantasy X is one of a series of fourteen games and I do believe Square Enix is still making more. I may be a little bias, since 
				I’m a girl and I haven’t played very many games but I have to say Final fantasy X has the best story line ever with action, fantasy, 
				adventures, twists and little bit of romance! I love, love, love it!</p>

			<h2 class="center">Deus Ex Human Revolution</h2>
				<a href="deusex.html"><img class="displaycenter" src="Images/Deus-Ex.jpg" alt="Deus Ex Logo" title="Click for an awesome review!"></a>
				<p>Deus Ex, pronounced d ˈdā-əs-ˌeks’ is a Latin term meaning “From God”, but don’t confuse that as a statement about religion.
				It is more saying that the God of people in the future is built in Artificial Intelligence.  I am sure the Human Revolution is pretty 
				self-explanatory.</p>

				<p>If you haven't heard of Minecraft then you've been living under a rock, because Minecraft has worked it's way into almost every
				part of internet culture. Minecraft is a sandbox creative game whose looks can be a little deceiving. If there was ever a game that
				fit the phrase "don't judge a book by it's cover", this is that game.</p>

			<h2 class="center">Dota 2</h2>
				<a href="dota2.html"><img class="displaycenter" src="Images/DotaLogo.jpg" alt="Dota 2 Logo" title="Click here for my review"></a>
				<p>You could call Dota 2 the ancestor of the original MOBA game, Dota. When DotA (Defence of the Ancients) was released as a mod
				in WarCraft 3 multiplayer, it became the largest sensation to hit the multiplayer online experience in a long time. Dota 2 captures
				that experience and expands on it.</p>
