			<h2>Art Gallery</h2>
			<p>Welcome to my art gallery! In this section of the website, I'm just going to dump a lot of my random drawings that I've done over the years.
			I will not make the claim that I am a great artist. In fact, I won't even make the claim that I'm a good artist, but nevertheless, I wanted
			a place to put all my stuff on the web.</p>

			<li><a href="Sketchs/Assassins.jpg" title="Assassins" alt="I made this in Photoshop back when Assassin's Creed 2 Brotherhood came out. I absolutely love the Assassin Creed games and the motto of the Assassin's just oozes epicness">
				<img src="Thumbs/Assassins.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Templars.jpg" title="Templars" alt="Made this right after I made the Assassin's Emblem. Since the Templars didn't really have a stated motto at the time, I just made something up using the symbol from Abstergo">
				<img src="Thumbs/Templars.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Second.jpg" title="Second Ever" alt="Oh my... I made this forever ago, back when I was first getting into drawing.. so middle school sometime. The reason he is wearing a glove is because I hate drawing hands. Please know that even I know that this one looks stupid ^-^">
				<img src="Thumbs/Second.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Sandled Fighter.jpg" title="The Sandled Fighter" alt="A small improvement from the other one. But, I did like it enough to color it in with color pencils. Again, with the hands thing. I really don't like drawing hands... so I used a little short cut that a friend showed me">
				<img src="Thumbs/Sandled.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Another_girl.jpg" title="Another Girl" alt="One thing I am quite good at is looking off of reference material and making a pretty good copy. I have no idea who this girl is or what anime she came from, I just saw the picture and thought I would draw it. It was colored using color pencils. Let me clarify that I DID NOT TRACE THIS! Tracing is an artist sin">
				<img src="Thumbs/Another_girl.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Artic Fox (sketch).jpg" title="Artic Fox" alt="As many people know about it, I love foxes!! So I end up drawing foxes all the time. This little guy came about while I wasn't paying attention in a math class">
				<img src="Thumbs/Artic.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Artic Fox.jpg" title="Artic Fox Colored" alt="So I liked my little math class fox so much that I took it to Photoshop and colored it! It was one of my first attempts at coloring my drawings using Photoshop and I'm pretty proud of how it turned out">
				<img src="Thumbs/Artic_colored.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Chaos Head.jpg" title="Chaos Head" alt="This is girl came from a rather creepy anime called Chaos:Head. She is one of the main characters and to be honest, it was such a long time ago that I don't remember her name. I like everything about the picture... except her hair... it got a little out of head. It was colored with color pencils">
				<img src="Thumbs/Chaos.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Edward Elric.jpg" title="Edward Elric" alt="Edward Elric is from the anime FullMetal Alchemist. Honestly, I think I did alright with this one, but his hands are a little messed up. But I suck at hands... so I let it slide">
				<img src="Thumbs/Edward.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Ellen.jpg" title="Ellen" alt="I drew this in some down time I have a work. This girl's name is Ellen. She comes from a game called Witch's House by Vgperson.com. It's a pretty simple but very gripping horror game where Ellen gets trapped in a house full of monsters, death traps, and killer teddy bears!">
				<img src="Thumbs/Ellen.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Fidget.jpg" title="Fidget" alt="Aw Fidget! If you've never played Dust: An Elysiam Tail, you better head over to Steam and get your hands on it!!! Dust is an indie game created by Humble Hearts. I just finished this game not to long ago and loved every minute of it! Fidget is the trusty sidekick and comedic element that makes the whole experience unforgettable!">
				<img src="Thumbs/Fidget.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Fox Present.jpg" title="Fox Present" alt="I drew this for Christmas one year for a friend of mine. I did use another drawing as a reference but I changed many details about the original drawing to make it my own. He's cute isn't he?">
				<img src="Thumbs/Fox_present.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Fox Present colored.jpg" title="Fox Present Colored" alt="I just couldn't help it, this cute little guy just had to be colored. There was no getting around it! I was very very pleased with the outcome of all of my hard work on this piece">
				<img src="Thumbs/Fox_present_color.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Honoka.jpg" title="Honoka" alt="I started an anime a long time ago called The Girl with the Blue Eye. It was pretty good but after a while I got a little bored of it and stopped watching it. But I did end up drawing the main girl, Honoka. Even though the pose is pretty crazy, I still think I did a really good job on it. In fact, I'm very proud of this one!">
				<img src="Thumbs/Honoka.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Kimiko Sketch2.jpg" title="Kimiko" alt="Here's another girl I drew using a reference. I even included that reference with the drawing, aren't I nice? I think I did ok. One day, I would really like to be able to draw people without having to look off of someone else's work... that will be a good day">
				<img src="Thumbs/Kimiko.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Kitsune Girl.jpg" title="Kitsune Girl" alt="Yet another example of my love for foxes!! I found this picture and fell in love with her innocent look and cute, over sized glasses! So I just had to draw her. Once again, here's an example of the fact that I hate drawing hands... hence why she doesn't have any hands ^-^">
				<img src="Thumbs/Kitsune.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Krystal.jpg" title="Krystal" alt="Everyone's favorite blue vixen, Krystal Fox from StarFox. I always really liked the StarFox games... but then when Krystal was introduced in StarFox Adventures... well let's just say that I'm always eagerly awaiting a new StarFox just to see what adventures Krystal and Fox McCloud are on. Plus, Krystal's hot ^-^">
				<img src="Thumbs/Krystal.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Rinoa.jpg" title="Rinoa" alt="If you don't recognize this girl, I'm actually not surprised... this girl's name is Rinoa from Final Fantasy 8. I think I did alright on it... but it really doesn't do Rinoa justice. I would need a lot more practice till I'm good enough to show Rinoa in all her beauty and glory">
				<img src="Thumbs/Rinoa.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
			<li><a href="Sketchs/Sakura Haruno.jpg" title="Sakura Haruno" alt="I love this picture. When I started it, I really wasn't sure how it would turn out, but I surprised myself! This girl is Sakura Haruno from the Naruto series. The only thing I messed up on when her feet. I just couldn't get them to look right. But regardless of that, I really think I captured her personality in this picture. A flirty, sexy ninja ^-^">
